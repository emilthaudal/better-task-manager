// ── Milestone (delivery program) API contract ────────────────────────────────
//
// Shared by the milestone API routes, the web milestone pages and (mirrored by
// hand in Swift) the native mac app. Everything here is plain JSON — arrays,
// not Sets — so the same payload decodes on every client.
//
// The model has three layers:
//   capability (LA, Jira Product Discovery idea)
//     ← implemented by → increment (epic in the delivery space, fix version = milestone)
//       ← implemented by → team epic (epic in a team space)
//         → work items (stories/tasks), sequenced by "blocks" links
